# mbel — Expression Engine for MoonBit

mbel is a native MoonBit expression-language engine for rules engines,
dynamic configuration, low-code platforms, and workflow orchestration.
It ships two expression dialects — a modern **standard dialect** with
typed semantics and static checking, and a locked **classic dialect
(legacy)** with JS-style dynamic semantics — evaluated by dual
execution engines (a walk-tree interpreter and a bytecode VM) under
safety budgets.

Current status: the **classic dialect's** full language and API surface
is locked and verified byte-for-byte by a 3,360+ expression
differential corpus; the **standard dialect** covers the modern syntax
family with typed runtime semantics, a static checker (Compile mode),
resource budgets, a builtin function library, `??`/`..`/`matches`
operators, and compile-time constant folding. The close-out roadmap is
tracked in [docs/coverage-vs-expr.md](docs/coverage-vs-expr.md) (status)
and [docs/expr-gap-analysis.md](docs/expr-gap-analysis.md) (rationale).

## Quick start (CLI)

The command-line runner evaluates expressions with an optional JSON
context:

```text
$ moon run cmd/main -- "1 + 2 * 3"
7

$ moon run cmd/main -- "'hello' + ' ' + 'world'"
"hello world"

$ moon run cmd/main -- "6+x*2>10 ? 'big' : 'small'" '{"x": 3}'
"big"

$ moon run cmd/main -- "age * (3 - 1)" '{"age": 36}'
72

$ moon run cmd/main -- 'assoc[.first == "Lana"].last' \
  '{"assoc": [{"first": "Lana", "last": "Kane"}, {"first": "Cyril", "last": "Figgis"}]}'
"Kane"

$ moon run cmd/main -- "user.name + ' scored ' + (score * 10)" \
  '{"user": {"name": "alice"}, "score": 8.5}'
"alice scored 85"

$ moon run cmd/main -- "items[.price <= 2].name" \
  '{"items": [{"name": "apple", "price": 1.5}, {"name": "pear", "price": 3}]}'
"apple"
```

Predicate aggregates work on both engines:

```text
$ moon run cmd/main -- "map(nums, # * 2)" '{"nums": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]}'
[2,4,6,8,10]

$ moon run cmd/main -- "filter(users, .age >= 18)[0].name" \
  '{"users": [{"name": "Alice", "age": 30}, {"name": "Bob", "age": 15}]}'
"Alice"

$ moon run cmd/main -- "sum(1..100)"
5050

$ moon run cmd/main -- "count(users, .age >= 18)" \
  '{"users": [{"name": "Alice", "age": 30}, {"name": "Bob", "age": 15}, {"name": "Cyx", "age": 24}]}'
2

$ moon run cmd/main -- "groupBy(nums, # % 2)" '{"nums": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]}'
{"1":[1,3,5],"0":[2,4]}

$ moon run cmd/main -- "reduce(nums, #acc + #, 100)" '{"nums": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]}'
115
```

Contexts are JSON: `null` → `nil`, numbers and nested objects/arrays
work as expected. A few demo transforms (`dbl`, `first`,
`concatWith`) are registered in the CLI, so pipes work too:

```text
$ moon run cmd/main -- "[1,2,3]|first"
1

$ moon run cmd/main -- "5|dbl|dbl"
20
```

## Playground (browser WASM)

A zero-install browser test page ships with the repo — the same engine
as the CLI and library, compiled to wasm-gc and wired to the three
dialect/mode entries with plain JS strings:

```text
cd playground && python3 -m http.server 8000   # then open http://localhost:8000
```

The page offers three dialect/mode selectors, a 🧩 custom-functions
drawer (load a functions `.json` file — format v1, see
[docs/en/functions.md](docs/en/functions.md) → "Expression-defined
functions"), plus ready-made examples:

- **standard dialect · Eval mode** — recommended; typed runtime
  semantics.
- **standard dialect · Compile mode (strict)** — the static checker
  runs first.
- **classic dialect (legacy)** — the v0.2 JS-semantics dialect;
  corpus-locked and receiving no new features.

Real AST (parse tree), bytecode (disassembly) and debug views sit next
to the result panel. The examples double as a dialect comparison:

Because dialects differ by design, an expression such as `1 + "a"`
errors under the standard dialect (typed), errors statically under
strict checking, and yields `"1a"` under the classic dialect (JS
semantics).

Rebuild the shipped wasm (wasm-gc release) with:

```text
moon build --target wasm-gc --release
cp _build/wasm-gc/release/build/playground/web/web.wasm playground/mbel.wasm
```

The browser entry lives in `playground/web` and exports
`eval_expr`/`eval_jexl`/`eval_checked` (each `(expr, env, engine)`),
`eval_with_functions` `(code, env, funcs_json, mode, engine)` — the env
doubles as the loaded functions' default bindings — `describe_functions`
(funcs_json → resolved signature list), `disassemble`/`dump_ast`; all
callable with plain JS strings via the js-string builtins integration
(no glue code). Requirements: Chrome/Edge 130+, Firefox 134+, Safari
18.4+; serve over HTTP, never `file://`. The wasm is stateless —
custom functions persist on the page (localStorage) and embedding hosts
must pass the funcs JSON on every call. Build and interop details:
AGENTS.md "Playground (browser WASM)".

## Using mbel as a library

The engine is organized into small packages — `grammar`, `lexer`,
`parser`, `ast`, `evaluator`, and `engine` (the top-level API):

```moonbit nocheck
import {
  "dimon-83/mbel/ast",
  "dimon-83/mbel/evaluator",
  "dimon-83/mbel/engine",
}

let inst = @engine.new()

// Evaluate against a context
let ctx = @ast.ObjectVal([
  ("user", @ast.ObjectVal([("age", @ast.NumVal(36.0))])),
])
let v = try {
  @engine.Engine::eval(inst, "user.age > 18 ? 'adult' : 'minor'", ctx)
} catch {
  @engine.EngineErr(msg) => abort(msg)
} // StrVal("adult")

// Register transforms / functions / operators
@engine.Engine::add_transform(
  inst,
  "dbl",
  fn(args : Array[@ast.Value]) -> @ast.Value {
    @ast.NumVal(@evaluator.to_number(args[0]) * 2.0)
  },
)
let doubled = try {
  @engine.Engine::eval(inst, "21|dbl", @ast.ObjectVal([]))
} catch {
  @engine.EngineErr(msg) => abort(msg)
} // NumVal(42.0)

// resource budgets: nodes at parse time, depth + steps at
// eval time (0 disables a limit)
@engine.Engine::set_limits(inst, 10000, 10000, 1000000)
```

### Expression-defined user functions (JSON)

Functions can also be defined **as data** — the body is an expression
source string compiled by the standard-dialect front end, loaded from a
JSON file (the playground's 🧩 card) or built directly:

```moonbit nocheck
// params omitted: auto-extracted from the body's free identifiers
let resolved = @engine.Engine::add_expression_functions(
  inst,
  [{ name: "tax", params: None, body: "price * rate" }],
  Some(ctx), // unpassed params fall back to same-named env keys
)
// resolved == [("tax", ["price", "rate"])] — usable as tax(…), x | tax(),
// and (classic dialect) x|tax; pass None instead for purely lexical params
```

Names must be valid identifiers and may not shadow aggregates;
validation is atomic; bodies run on the instance's current engine with
a per-function Vm program cache. File format v1, validation rules and
persistence semantics (the wasm is stateless — hosts persist the JSON):
see [docs/en/functions.md](docs/en/functions.md) →
"Expression-defined functions".

### Choosing an engine: Walk (tree-walk) or Vm (bytecode)

mbel ships two execution engines that share one semantic layer, so
they produce identical results and identical error messages (asserted
by an internal parity suite over the whole differential corpus). Pick
the engine per instance:

```moonbit nocheck
// Walk — the reference tree-walk interpreter (default)
let walk_inst = @engine.new()
@engine.Engine::set_engine(walk_inst, Walk)

// Vm — compiles the (constant-folded) AST to bytecode once per
// Expression, caches the program, and runs a 26-opcode stack machine
let vm_inst = @engine.new()
@engine.Engine::set_engine(vm_inst, Vm)

// Both engines run the same expressions, transforms, and budgets
let ctx = @ast.ObjectVal([("x", @ast.NumVal(3.0))])
let a = @engine.Engine::eval(walk_inst, "6+x*2>10 ? 'big' : 'small'", ctx)
let b = @engine.Engine::eval(vm_inst, "6+x*2>10 ? 'big' : 'small'", ctx)
// value_equal(a, b) — always true; vm_parity tests enforce it

// The CLI can run either engine too:
//   moon run cmd/main -- "2+2*3" "" vm
```

Engine notes: the Vm mode's value is the compiled `Program` cached on
each `Expression` (re-evaluations skip compilation entirely);
`FilterExpression` subtrees and manual-eval (lazy) operators are
executed by tree-walk callbacks that share the step budget, so
budgets behave identically on both engines.

### Dialects and evaluation modes (stage 4.4.5)

The engine separates the classic dialect (legacy) from the
standard-dialect front end, which has two evaluation modes:

- `Engine::eval(inst, src, ctx)` — **classic dialect (legacy)**: the
  v0.2 grammar, JS dynamic semantics (numbers are doubles, loose `==`,
  substring `in`), locked by the compatibility differential corpus and
  the legacy test suites.
- `Engine::eval_expr(inst, src, ctx)` — **standard dialect, Eval
  mode**: full modern syntax, typed runtime semantics — integer
  literals and integer arithmetic are typed `IntVal` (int64, Go wrap),
  `/` is always float division (`7/2 = 3.5`, `1/0 = +Inf`), `%` is
  integer-only, cross-kind comparisons/`+` raise
  `invalid operation: ...` at runtime. No static checks.
- `Engine::eval_expr_checked(inst, src, ctx)` — **standard dialect,
  Compile mode**: runs the static checker first; statically-known type
  violations surface compile-mode messages (`invalid operation: +
  (mismatched types int and string)`, `non-bool expression (type int)
  used as condition`).

All three entries run on either engine (Walk or Vm) with identical
results, and all honor `set_limits` budgets (the standard dialect
applies `max_nodes` at parse time).

## Current capabilities (classic dialect)

- **Literals**: numbers, single/double-quoted strings with escapes,
  booleans; **array** and **object** literals (`{a: 1, "b": 2}`).
- **Operators**: arithmetic `+ - * / // % ^`, comparison
  `== != > >= < <=` with JavaScript coercion semantics, logic
  `&& || !`, `in` (substring / array membership), ternary `?:`
  including the `a ?: b` form.
- **Access**: dotted chains `a.b.c`, computed keys `obj["k"]`, array
  indexing, **relative filters** `arr[.x == 1]` with element-0 drill
  semantics, transforms via `|` pipes (`foo|toUpper`), and custom
  function calls `f(x)`.
- **Extensibility**: `add_transform`, `add_function`, `add_binary_op`
  (incl. manual/lazy operand evaluation), `add_unary_op`, `remove_op`,
  `get_transform` / `get_function` — each engine instance owns an
  isolated grammar (elements can be added and removed per instance).
- **Safety**: configurable node limit (default 10 000), sub-expression
  nesting limit, eval depth and shared step budgets — safety protections
  beyond the classic baseline.
- **Verification**: 111 MoonBit tests mirror the original Jest suites
  (lexer/parser/evaluator/API), and a differential harness runs 3 300+
  expressions (hand-written corpus, generated fuzz, JSON-context
  corpus) against the original JavaScript implementation, requiring
  byte-identical output (`tools/`, `docs/parity-contract.md`).

## Builtins already available

The engine is seeded with builtins (registered on
every instance, callable as plain functions): `abs ceil floor round
max min mean median`, `trim trimPrefix trimSuffix upper lower split
splitAfter replace repeat join indexOf lastIndexOf hasPrefix hasSuffix
string`, `len first last get take keys values reverse uniq concat
flatten sort`, `int float string type toJSON fromJSON toBase64
fromBase64 toPairs fromPairs`, `bitand bitor bitxor bitnand bitnot
bitshl bitshr bitushr`, plus minimal `now duration date timezone`.
Three standard-dialect operators work too: `??` (nil coalescing), `..` (range:
`1..3 == [1,2,3]`), and `matches`. Constant subtrees are folded at
compile time (constant folding).

Examples:

```text
$ moon run cmd/main -- "median([1, 9, 5])"
5

$ moon run cmd/main -- "fromBase64(toBase64("héllo ✓"))"
"héllo ✓"

$ moon run cmd/main -- "missing ?? 'fallback'"
"fallback"

$ moon run cmd/main -- "sort([3,1,2]) | first"
1
```

## Roadmap

Stage 4 (the standard-dialect language layer) is in its close-out
phase. Remaining items — the verifiable list lives in
[docs/coverage-vs-expr.md](docs/coverage-vs-expr.md) §6.2 item 8:

- **4.4 close-out**: byte-string evaluation, position-carrying checker
  errors (`行:列` with caret), classic-package physical split, Options
  alignment (env whitelist, AsBool), and the reference TestExpr
  167-line want-table transcription.
- **4.5**: full regex for `matches` (the MoonBit core regex is
  literal-only), full time objects/timezones, and implicit time-string
  arithmetic (`request.Time - resource.Age < duration("24h")`).

Already delivered: the standard-dialect syntax layer (4.4.1/4.4.2),
typed value model (4.4.3), static checker with the Compile-mode entry
(4.4.4), locked dialect/mode API (4.4.5 surface), dual-engine parity,
safety budgets, builtin library, and the browser playground. Items
that cannot map 1:1 to MoonBit (Go-reflection struct environments, the
Go `time`/`regexp` dependencies) are tracked as explicit cut items in
[docs/expr-gap-analysis.md](docs/expr-gap-analysis.md).

## Performance & stability report (Walk vs Vm)

Full three-target report in [docs/perf-report.md](docs/perf-report.md).
Both engines share one semantic layer (instructions only dispatch), so
results and error messages are identical by construction and by test.
> ⚠️ The Vm columns of earlier reports (2026-09-06, incl. the tables in
> docs/perf-report.md) are invalid: the end-to-end `Expression::eval`
> never dispatched to the Vm engine until f37f10d, so those "Vm"
> measurements were the tree-walk engine. The tables below and
> docs/coverage-vs-expr.md §7 are the first genuine dual-engine data.

Latest paired benchmarks, same batch (wasm-gc / moonrun; native in
parentheses), 10×N runs, mean:

| Scenario | Walk | Vm |
|---|---|---|
| Precompiled eval (constant-folded) | 13.2 ns (22.9) | 23.2 ns (50.0) |
| Ternary + logic + `??` chain | 107 ns (112) | 76.1 ns (85.8) |
| 50-term un-foldable chain | 1.60 µs (1.35) | 846 ns (615) |
| End-to-end compile + eval | 6.33 µs (13.8) | 6.37 µs (14.4) |
| 100-item relative filter | 4.48 µs (5.50) | 3.72 µs (3.10) |
| 100-item long-predicate filter | 16.3 µs (24.6) | 10.0 µs (7.60) |
| Aggregate `map` over 100 items | 3.57 µs (4.31) | 3.33 µs (3.03) |
| Aggregate `filter`+`sum` over 100 items | 6.09 µs (7.02) | 4.76 µs (4.17) |
| String builtin chain | 527 ns (520) | 472 ns (540) |
| `toJSON`/`fromJSON` roundtrip | 639 ns (839) | 619 ns (932) |
| Tokenize only (engine-independent) | 3.10 µs (5.88) | — |

Reading the numbers: on **iteration-shaped loads** (filters, aggregate
loops, long chains) the Vm leads on every target — the native-backend
gap is the widest (long-predicate filter −69%, aggregates −30% to
−41%, 50-term chain −55%), because the Vm's native relative-filter
loop and typed-slot aggregate loop (one reused sub-VM per aggregate)
remove the per-element allocation tree-walks pay; js (V8 JIT) narrows
the gap by JIT-compiling the recursive walk. On **micro loads**
(folded-constant eval, JSON round-trips) the Vm trails by a fixed
per-eval setup cost. Choose by workload profile — full data and
analysis: [docs/coverage-vs-expr.md](docs/coverage-vs-expr.md) §7.

Stability invariants are asserted **per engine** with one shared
suite (`engine_test/stability_test.mbt`): instance isolation, 500×
deterministic re-evaluation, budget non-bypass against 100k-element
contexts, recovery after parse/transform/budget failures, interleaved
multi-instance evaluation, nesting/wide-structure limits, and
1000-record JSON contexts — all green on both engines. Three
independent safety nets guard behavior: 168 unit/parity tests (green
on native, wasm-gc and js), the internal Walk-vs-Vm parity corpus (207
expressions, results and error messages byte-equal — genuinely green
since f37f10d restored the Vm dispatch), and the external
differential harness against the original implementation (3,360+
expressions, byte-identical).
